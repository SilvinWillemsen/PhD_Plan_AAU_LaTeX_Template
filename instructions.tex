\section*{PhD Plan Instructions}
\textbf{A PhD plan is required by the legal regulations of PhD studies in Denmark and is therefore mandatory for all students. It is expected that the supervisors take an active part in the production of the plan.}
\\
\\
The PhD plan is a \textbf{tool} for directing the development of a PhD process. It is meant as a \textbf{communication} element between the student, the supervisor, and the PhD administration. This tool can help the students and the supervisors formulate and concretize the elements involved in a research process. From the administration point-of-view, it is a tool to judging the extent to which the proposed research can be realized within the framework of a PhD study. It is therefore recommended that the student’s and supervisor’s progress reports are based on the PhD plan.
\\
\\
The PhD plan must be submitted no later than two months after the start of the studies. After 10 months the PhD plan is updated according to the progress. A reminder will be send out to the PhD student about this at 10 months. The updated plan, referred to as the 12-month plan, has to be submitted before 12 months. It will be evaluated at a public status seminar which is to be held around 11 months of studies. At this seminar, the student will present the 12-month plan followed by a discussion led by an opponent. After this seminar, the PhD student will update the plan in accordance with the feedback received at the seminar. Further details regarding the status seminar can be found in a separate document at the Doctoral School’s homepage under Forms and Templates (https://www.phd.tech.aau.dk/current-students/forms-templates/).   \\
\\
Timeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 months: deadline for submission of 2-month plan
    \item 10 months: update study plan reminder
    \item 11 months: status seminar
    \item 12 months: deadline for submission of 12-month plan 
\end{itemize}
The template here is intended to help the students and supervisors consider the different elements of the PhD process. The template is the same for both the 2- the 12-month plans, but it is expected that the 12-month plan is much more concrete and elaborate. The particular areas that you must pay attention to with regards to the-12 month plan are written in italic. The PhD plan should be specific and as short as possible while still containing the necessary information.
\\
\\
The PhD plan must be uploaded through the PhD manager portal found at the following address: https://phdwebaau.sdu.dk. Please use your AAU signon.
\\
\\
A proper scientific conduct must be demonstrated throughout the PhD plan. For guidelines see the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (https://ufm.dk/publikationer/2014/filer-2014/the-danish-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity.pdf).\\
\\
\textbf{The PhD plan should not exceed 10 pages (12 point font size, 20 mm margins on all sides) excluding front page and list of references.}\\
